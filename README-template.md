## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - For render

### What I learned

This project added a lot of knowledge and allowed me to recap or consolidate a lot of what I had already learned from react to the basics like html and css and new things like working with featch which is a native feature of js since I have always worked with axios. It was a pleasure working on this project.

### Continued development

This project also has points to be made right with the research aspect which takes a long time to search for information in the api, giving the impression to the user that there is bang to render on the screen, also the standardization aspect of the project which I don't really like since the names of variable functions and responsiveness in the case of card ordering and the back button, among other aspects.
